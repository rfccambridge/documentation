1. (Mac and Linux users) Install VMware (Fusion on Mac). For Linux, you
can get VMware Player for free from their website. MIT people, for Mac, 
you can grab VMware Fusion from IS&T's website under the Software section
(there's a link to a license key you'll need). You can also grab a Windows7 image
from IS&T and run that under VMware -- just search for Windows (the
Student version on IS&T seems fine). For Harvard people on a Mac, you can get
VMware Fusion from any class you are in that uses a virtual machine.

2. Get Visual Studio 2010 from Microsoft Dreamspark
(https://www.dreamspark.com/student/default.aspx) -- you'll need to
register with your .edu address there. This is what we use as an
environment to write/compile/debug code. Install it on Windows and make
sure to select Visual C# during the installation.

3. If you don't have one, create a github (http://github.com) account
and send me your username so I can give you access to our codebase.
Github is the place where we keep all our code. Once I've added you, in
the upper left corner of the site, you'll be able to switch between your
personal user and "rfccambridge".

4. Grab a Git client for windows (http://msysgit.github.com/) and
install it. Git is what we use for version control of our code. Don't
worry if you haven't used it before -- I'll go over the basics quickly
at next meeting. Also, if you like nice GUIs, you can install
TortoiseGIT (https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/), which integrates
GIT nicely with windows explorer.

5. Once you have all that, you should be ready to go. You can grab a
local version of the code by going to github and finding the
rfccambridge/rfc repository (https://github.com/rfccambridge/rfc). At
the top, there are HTTP and SSH links. You can grab the HTTP one and
"git clone" that into an empty folder on your windows machine. After
asking for your github password and waiting for a while, you'll see the
source files in that folder. Try opening
resources/workspaces/AllProjects.sln and compiling it in Visual Studio.

5.1. If you haven't used version control or git before, there are a ton
of online tutorials to get you started. This one
(http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/easy-version-control-with-git/)
seems particularly easy to follow and shows you what you can do. In any
case, taking some time to learn version control should definitely pay
off if you plan to do any software development in the real world.

6. Installing the runtimes for the RefBox. The RefBox is the application that
allows us to manually referee a game. It lives in the main source tree under
resources/RefBox. There are two GTK library runtimes in that folder that you
need to install if you want to run a refbox.
